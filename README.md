The order confirmation page displays the details of the order along with the total cost of the order. The cost of the order is determined using the price calculator module described below. This page displays two buttons – one to cancel the order and the other to confirm the order. Cancelling the order simply returns to the previous page. Confirming the order displays an order confirmation message, approximate time of delivery for the pizza. Save the order information as a JSON file to a folder in your website when the order is confirmed. Explore the Node API to write the JSON file to the disk.
